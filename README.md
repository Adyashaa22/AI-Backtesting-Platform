The core objective of this project is to create a unified platform combining live paper trading, historical backtesting, and machine learning agent integration into a single coherent framework. The system incorporates a multi-threaded backend that receives real-time SmartAPI WebSocket tick data, aggregates ticks into OHLCV candles, and passes them to a trading agent capable of making Buy, Sell, or Hold decisions. The trading agent can be rule-based, random (baseline), or a reinforcement learning model, making the platform compatible with future advancements in machine learning-driven trading systems. A dedicated PaperTradingEngine simulates real market executions by accounting for brokerage, slippage, order quantity, and transaction costs to approximate realistic trading outcomes.
